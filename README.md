# Debug Changelog:
Apr-24-2017 9:37PM EDT:
*  Forgot I lowered the resolution to 800x600 but left the UI scaled for 1024x768!
  *  This lead to the Play button being inverted (made it invisible), the Score display was cut off, and the game status UI element was under the Penalty timer. Sorry for the inconvenience!
