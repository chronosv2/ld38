A Small World
Twin-Stick Shooter:
World Collapse Mechanic -- as something happens (what?) the world collapses and crumbles around you,
  reducing your play area.

  As for "what"?
    As structures are destroyed?
    As time progresses?

5-Minute timer
"Support Structures" that, as they are destroyed, lower the timer.
World shrinks in size every minute
At the end of 5 minutes, the final piece of the world gives and game ends.
Dying imobilizes you for 3 seconds, giving enemies a chance to damage the world and deplete the world faster.
